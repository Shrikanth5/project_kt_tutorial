# Project Architecture Documentation

## System Overview

This project follows a modern microservices architecture with a clear separation between frontend and backend components. The system is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and follows best practices for enterprise applications.

### High-Level Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Frontend
        UI[React Frontend]
        State[State Management]
        API[API Client]
    end
    
    subgraph Backend
        Controllers[Spring Controllers]
        Services[Business Services]
        Repositories[Data Repositories]
        Security[Security Layer]
    end
    
    subgraph Database
        DB[(Database)]
    end
    
    UI --> API
    API --> Controllers
    Controllers --> Services
    Services --> Repositories
    Repositories --> DB
    Security --> Controllers
```

## Component Details

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using React with TypeScript, following a component-based architecture:

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Components
        Pages[Page Components]
        Shared[Shared Components]
        Layout[Layout Components]
    end
    
    subgraph State
        Redux[Redux Store]
        Actions[Actions]
        Reducers[Reducers]
    end
    
    subgraph Services
        API[API Services]
        Utils[Utilities]
    end
    
    Pages --> Shared
    Pages --> Layout
    Pages --> State
    State --> Services
```

### Backend Architecture

The backend follows a layered architecture pattern:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Presentation Layer
        Controllers[Controllers]
        DTOs[DTOs]
    end
    
    subgraph Business Layer
        Services[Services]
        Security[Security]
    end
    
    subgraph Data Layer
        Repositories[Repositories]
        Entities[Entities]
    end
    
    Controllers --> Services
    Services --> Repositories
    Security --> Controllers
    Repositories --> Entities
```

## Security Architecture

The application implements a comprehensive security model:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Authentication
        JWT[JWT Authentication]
        OAuth[OAuth2]
    end
    
    subgraph Authorization
        Roles[Role-Based Access]
        Permissions[Permissions]
    end
    
    subgraph Security Config
        Filters[Security Filters]
        Interceptors[Interceptors]
    end
    
    JWT --> Filters
    OAuth --> Filters
    Filters --> Roles
    Roles --> Permissions
```

## Data Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant Frontend
    participant Backend
    participant Database
    
    Client->>Frontend: HTTP Request
    Frontend->>Backend: API Call
    Backend->>Backend: Authentication
    Backend->>Backend: Authorization
    Backend->>Database: Query
    Database-->>Backend: Response
    Backend-->>Frontend: API Response
    Frontend-->>Client: HTTP Response
```

## Deployment Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Production
        LB[Load Balancer]
        subgraph Frontend Cluster
            F1[Frontend 1]
            F2[Frontend 2]
        end
        subgraph Backend Cluster
            B1[Backend 1]
            B2[Backend 2]
        end
        DB[(Database)]
    end
    
    LB --> Frontend Cluster
    Frontend Cluster --> Backend Cluster
    Backend Cluster --> DB
```

## Quality Assurance Architecture

The project implements a comprehensive quality assurance strategy:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Testing
        Unit[Unit Tests]
        Integration[Integration Tests]
        E2E[E2E Tests]
    end
    
    subgraph CI/CD
        Build[Build Pipeline]
        Test[Test Pipeline]
        Deploy[Deploy Pipeline]
    end
    
    subgraph Monitoring
        Logs[Logging]
        Metrics[Metrics]
        Alerts[Alerts]
    end
    
    Build --> Test
    Test --> Deploy
    Deploy --> Monitoring
```
